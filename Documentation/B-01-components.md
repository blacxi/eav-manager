## External Bundles

### Sidus/EAVModelBundle ###

Allows fast data modeling using a custom EAV model built upon Doctrine.
The model description is versioned in Yaml files instead of stored in the database along the actual data, this provides
less flexibility than a traditional EAV model for the end-user - as it's not directly editable using the user interface-,
but it does provide a significant gain in features, robustness and performances as well as being more customisable by
the developers.
